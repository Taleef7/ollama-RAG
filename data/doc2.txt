Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, through a process that uses sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is also released as a byproduct. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.
